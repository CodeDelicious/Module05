#project
A project that I am working on currently is to develope a basic game.
  It will be similar to the game risk.
  It will have 3D models of the map and units.
  Will not be turned based or involve a dice.
  Will all work in real time.
This project will use the copyright licence to ensure no other can duplicate my project.
